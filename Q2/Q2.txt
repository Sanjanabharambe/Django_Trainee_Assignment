Question 2:Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
Answer =>es, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default.

This means when a signal is triggered (e.g., post_save), the connected signal handler runs in the same execution thread that called the original function like .save() or .create().
