Question 3: By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
Answer => Yes, by default Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.
That means if the caller is wrapped in a transaction, and the transaction is rolled back later, any changes made in the signal handler are also rolled back.
 Django signals (like post_save) run in the same DB transaction as the caller by default.
